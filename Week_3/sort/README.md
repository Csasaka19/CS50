# Sort

## Merge, Selection and Bubble Sort.

This repository contains txt files that has numbers either in sorted, reversed or random orders respectively.
The executable files sort1.c, sort2.c and sort3.c have already implemented sorts(merge, bubble and selection).
Analysis is required to determine which executable is exactly which sort.

An example of the implementation is shown in the image:

P.S the time function is essential to know the time taken in each case.
