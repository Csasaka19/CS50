Ask user for card details and check if it is an integer
If it is not repeat the loop till it is
Ignore hyphens and spaces in the code input
To check if card is valid Luhn's algorithm is used.Steps are as follows:
Multiply every other digit by 2, starting with the number’s second-to-last digit, and then add those products’ digits together.
Add the sum to the sum of the digits that weren’t multiplied by 2.
If the total’s last digit is 0 (or, put more formally, if the total modulo 10 is congruent to 0), the number is valid!
Afterwards check if the card is a Visa starts with 4, American Express card(Amex) starts 34 or 37 or Mastercard starts with 51-55
or if it is invalid whatsover
the length of Visa is 13 or 16
The length of American Express card is 15 digits
The length of a Master card is 16 digits
AMEX\n or MASTERCARD\n or VISA\n or INVALID\n should be the outputs.
